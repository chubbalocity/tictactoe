# Celia Chesebro 
# Ian Hutcheson
# Nathaniel Mcrae

### TO DO
# minimax algo
# try to break things to catch edge cases

### COMPLETED REQUIREMENTS
# ask user for name
# ask user by name if they want to play x or o (x goes first)
# automatically assigns other marker to the other player.
# give option to play pc or player
# computer selects position (randomly)
# display the board after each run
# handle incorrect inputs
# add move logging to tictactoe.txt
# prints message for winner and exits

### COMPLETED Other ###
# stalemate logic
# no recursive loops - turn into while
# naming convention - at least it's fairly consistent? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
## Two programs combined - moved much of Ian's logic onto Celias Framework, switched to #s instead of letters
#>convert to #'s and make other functions play nicely
#>tuple to list, remove played moves from list
#> no wait time, some time announcements instead
#>move some noisy logic to logfile (logging)

### IMPORTS
